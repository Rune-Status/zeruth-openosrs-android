# osrs-android-port  
Android Studio project with the intentions of replicating necessary java.awt usage in the android environment.  
  
Current features:  
  
Full AWT software rendering (50 fps unless your resolution is absurd)  
Logging in / world interacting  
Reflection checks (required for jagex to not input block you)  
Touch Support (some issues still but usable)  
  
## Building  
  
Setup a virtual android device or use your own to launch the ```app``` module  
(minimum api 26)  
  
## Running
  
Due to the lack of keyboard support, The client will automatically login using supplied username and password in MainActivity
  
## Why tho  
  
This is specifically targeting RSPS work, but will be maintained for the live game as long as possible  
  
## Contributing  
  
Please do.
